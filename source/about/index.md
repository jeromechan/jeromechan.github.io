**[4] Hyde For Jekyll v3.0+**

The original version doesn't support Jekyll v3 currently. At the same time, poole/hyde doesn't accept pull request for a long time. We suggest every developer to finish compatible jobs with Jekyll v3.
So, we developed not only to help the original Hyde support Jekyll v3, but also provide useful features for blogging.
