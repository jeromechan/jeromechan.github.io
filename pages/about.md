**[2] Lumos Shadowsocks Dashboard**

Lumos is an easier way to provide and manage shadowsocks accounts for multiple users. The name 'lumos' is aimed at remembering the promotion system of Tuniu Corperation which was my first long supported project.

**[3] Pandoc Wrapper for PHP**

Pandoc-php-wrapper is a native wrapper for the Pandoc commands. Pandoc is a Haskell program that allows you to convert documents from one format to another.

**[4] Hyde For Jekyll v3.0+**

The original version doesn't support Jekyll v3 currently. At the same time, poole/hyde doesn't accept pull request for a long time. We suggest every developer to finish compatible jobs with Jekyll v3.
So, we developed not only to help the original Hyde support Jekyll v3, but also provide useful features for blogging.
